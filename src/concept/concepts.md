# Concept for the compiler

Mainly used as a memo so I dont have to rely on my sheet of paper where I made some notes. 

## Language

### Version 1

-) Scopes start with a statement implying a scope and end with ```ende``` <br>
-) Anything can be declared inside of any scope, yet is only reachable in the same scope <br>
-) The entirity of the program is wrapped inside of the "program - scope" <br>
-) Comments to the code are started in any line with "#"

PRECOMPILER: 

=================================

Precompiler directives are implyed by a tilde (~).

```~einf端gen```

copies an external file into the currently compiled file. Is first searched in the standard folder, then relatively from the compiler file. <br>
example: 

```~einf端gen funktion1.dh```

=================================

```~definieren```

defines a constant variable of either "char" or "int". <br>
example:

```~definieren pi = 31415```
```~definieren hallo = "HALLO"```

================================

```~schreiben```

prints out a constant string or a variable defined by ```~definieren```. No concatenation possible. <br>
example: ```~schreiben "hallo"```

================================

STATEMENTS:

================================

```anfang```

```anfang``` implies a scope; it is the function where the execution of the program starts, and is required exactly once. <br>

example: 
```
anfang
	#
ende
```

===============================

```funktion```

```funktion``` defines a later usable function. It has a name and a return type which are indicated like so: ```funktion [name] gibt [type] zur端ck```.
It implies a scope.

Example:
```
funktion sinus gibt fliesskommazahl zur端ck
	#code
ende
```
